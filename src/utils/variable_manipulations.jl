    specific(ρχ, ρ)
    specific(ρaχ, ρa, ρχ, ρ, turbconv_model)

Calculates the specific quantity `χ` (per unit mass) from a density-weighted
quantity. This function uses multiple dispatch to select the appropriate
calculation method based on the number of arguments.

**Grid-Scale Method (2 arguments)**

    specific(ρχ, ρ)

Performs a direct division of the density-weighted quantity `ρχ` by the density
`ρ`. This method is used for grid-mean quantities where the density `ρ` is
well-defined and non-zero.

**SGS Regularized Method (5 arguments)**

    specific(ρaχ, ρa, ρχ, ρ, turbconv_model)

Calculates the specific quantity `χ` for a subgrid-scale (SGS) component by
dividing the density-area-weighted quantity `ρaχ` by the density-area product
`ρa`.

This method includes regularization to handle cases where the SGS area fraction
(and thus `ρa`) is zero or vanishingly small. It performs a linear
interpolation between the SGS specific quantity (`ρaχ / ρa`) and the grid-mean
specific quantity (`ρχ / ρ`). The interpolation weight is computed by
`sgs_weight_function` to ensure a smooth and numerically stable transition,
preventing division by zero. Using this regularized version instead of directly
computing `ρaχ / ρa` breaks the assumption of domain decomposition (sum of SGS
domains equals GS) when the approximated area fraction `a` is small.

Arguments:
- `ρχ`: The grid-mean density-weighted quantity (e.g., `ρe_tot`, `ρq_tot`).
- `ρ`: The grid-mean density.
- `ρaχ`: The density-area-weighted SGS quantity (e.g., `sgs.ρa * sgs.h_tot`).
- `ρa`: The density-area product of the SGS component.
- `ρχ_fallback`: The grid-mean density-weighted quantity used for the fallback value.
- `ρ_fallback`: The grid-mean density used for the fallback value.
- `turbconv_model`: The turbulence convection model, containing parameters for regularization (e.g., `a_half`).

Applies a given function `f` to each grid-scale scalar variable (except `ρ` and  `ρe_tot`)

This utility abstracts the process of iterating over all scalars. It uses
`tracer_names` to identify the relevant variables and `unrolled_foreach` to
ensure a performant loop. For each tracer, it calls the provided function `f`
with the tendency field, the state field, and a boolean flag indicating if
the current tracer is `ρq_tot` (to allow for special handling).

Arguments:

 """
    sgs_weight_function(a, a_half)

Computes a smooth, monotonic weight function `w(a)` that ranges from 0 to 1.

This function is used as the interpolation weight in the regularized `specific`
function. It ensures a numerically stable and smooth transition between a subgrid-scale 
(SGS) quantity and its grid-mean counterpart, especially when the SGS area fraction `a` 
is small.

**Key Properties:**
- `w(a) = 0` for `a ≤ 0`.
- `w(a) = 1` for `a ≥ 1`.
- `w(a_half) = 0.5`.
- The function is continuously differentiable, with derivatives equal to zero at
  `a = 0` and `a = 1`, which ensures smooth blending.
- The functions grows very rapidly near `a = a_half`, and grows very slowly at all other 
  values of `a`.
- For small `a_half`, the weight rapidly approaches 1 for values of `a` that are
  a few times larger than `a_half`.

**Construction Method:**
The function is piecewise. For `a` between 0 and 1, it is a custom sigmoid curve
constructed in two main steps to satisfy the key properties:
1.  **Bounded Sigmoid Creation**: A base sigmoid is created that maps the interval
    `(0, 1)` to `(0, 1)` with zero derivatives at the endpoints. This is achieved
    by composing a standard `tanh` function with the inverse of a slower-growing
    `tanh` function.
2.  **Midpoint Control**: To ensure the function passes through the control point
    `(a_half, 0.5)`, the input `a` is first transformed by a specially designed
    power function (`1 - (1 - a)^k`) before being passed to the bounded sigmoid.
    This transformation maps `a_half` to `0.5` while preserving differentiability 
    at the boundaries.

Arguments:
- `a`: The input SGS area fraction (often approximated as `ρa / ρ`).
- `a_half`: The value of `a` at which the weight function should be 0.5, controlling
          the transition point of the sigmoid curve.

Returns:
- The computed weight, a value between 0 and 1.

Arguments:
- `specific_state`: A `NamedTuple` or a `Tuple` of `NamedTuple`s from which to
                    remove the `:e_tot` field.

Returns:
- A new `NamedTuple` or `Tuple` without the `:e_tot` field(s).

    matching_subfields(tendency_field, specific_field)

Given a field that contains the tendencies of variables of the form `ρχ` or
`ρaχ` and another field that contains the values of specific variables `χ`,
returns all tuples `(tendency_field.<ρχ or ρaχ>, specific_field.<χ>, :<χ>)`.
Variables in `tendency_field` that do not have matching variables in
`specific_field` are omitted, as are variables in `specific_field` that do not
have matching variables in `tendency_field`. This function is needed to avoid
allocations due to failures in type inference, which are triggered when the
`propertynames` of these fields are manipulated during runtime in order to pick
out the matching subfields (as of Julia 1.8).
