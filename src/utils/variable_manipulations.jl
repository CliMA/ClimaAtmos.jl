    sgs_weight_function(a, a_half)

Computes the weight of the SGS variables in the linear interpolation used in
`divide_by_ρa`. This is a continuously differentiable and monotonically
increasing function of `a` that is equal to 0 when `a ≤ 0`, is equal to 1 when
`a ≥ 1`, is equal to `1 / 2` when `a = a_half`, grows very rapidly near
`a = a_half`, and grows very slowly at all other values of `a`.  If `a_half` is
sufficiently small, this function is essentially equal to 1 for all `a` more
than a few times larger than `a_half` (up to floating-point precision).

We will now provide a description of how this function was constructed. We need
the function to be equal to 0 when `a ≤ 0` and equal to 1 when `a ≥ 1`. Since
the function must also be continuously differentiable, its derivative at these
values of `a` has to be 0. To obtain a function with these properties, we use a
piecewise definition:
    - For all `a < 0`, the function is equal to 0.
    - For all `a > 1`, the function is equal to 1.
    - For all `0 ≤ a ≤ 1`, the function is a sigmoid that connects the point
      `(0, 0)` to the point `(1, 1)`, with a derivative of 0 at these points.
Most well-known sigmoid functions connect the "points" `(-Inf, 0)` and
`(Inf, 1)`, not `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`. To obtain the desired sigmoid curve, we
begin with two simple sigmoid functions that go from `(-Inf, 0)` to `(Inf, 1)`
at different rates. In this case, we use two `tanh` functions, scaled and
translated so that they lie between 0 and 1:
    - `fast_sigmoid(a) = (1 + tanh(a)) / 2` and
    - `slow_sigmoid(a) = (1 + tanh(a / 2)) / 2`.
Note that the second sigmoid is commonly called the "logistic" function. We then
take the inverse of the sigmoid that grows more slowly, and we make that the
input of the sigmoid that grows more quickly:
    - `sigmoid(a) = fast_sigmoid(slow_sigmoid⁻¹(a)) =
       (1 + tanh(2 * atanh(2 * a - 1))) / 2`.
The resulting function goes from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)`, and, since the outer
sigmoid grows more quickly, it has the same asymptotic behavior as the outer
sigmoid, which means that its derivative at the boundary points is 0. If we had
instead put the sigmoid that grows more slowly on the outside, the asymptotic
behavior would come from the inverted inner sigmoid, which means that the
derivative at the boundary points would be `Inf`.

The sigmoid function we have constructed reaches `1 / 2` when `a = 1 / 2`. More
generally, we need the weight function to reach `1 / 2` when `a` is some small
value `a_half`. To achieve this, we replace the input to the sigmoid function
with a smooth, monotonically increasing function that goes through `(0, 0)`,
`(a_half, 1 / 2)`, and `(1, 1)`. The simplest option is the power function
    - `power(a) = a^(-1 / log2(a_half))`.
However, this function does not work well because, when `a_half < 1 / 2`, its
derivative at `a = 0` is `Inf`, and its derivative at `a = 1` is some positive
number. Making this power function the input to the sigmoid function causes the
derivative of the sigmoid to become `Inf` at `a = 0` when `a_half < 1 / 4`, and
it causes the sigmoid to grow too slowly from `1 / 2` to 1, only reaching 1 when
`a` is significantly larger than `a_half`. In order to fix this, we transform
the power function by replacing `a` with `1 - a`, `a_half` with `1 - a_half`,
and `power(a)` with `1 - power(a)`, which gives us
    - `power(a) = 1 - (1 - a)^(-1 / log2(1 - a_half))`.
This transformed function works better because, when `a_half < 1 / 2`, its
derivative at `a = 0` is some positive number, and its derivative at `a = 1` is
0. When we make this the input to the sigmoid function, the result has a
continuous derivative and is essentially equal to 1 for all `a` more than a few
times larger than `a_half`. So, for all `0 ≤ a ≤ 1`, we define the weight
function as
    - `weight(a) = sigmoid(power(a)) =
       (1 + tanh(2 * atanh(1 - 2 * (1 - a)^(-1 / log2(1 - a_half))))) / 2`.

    divide_by_ρa(ρaχ, ρa, ρχ, ρ, turbconv_model)

Computes `ρaχ / ρa`, regularizing the result to avoid issues when `a` is small.
This is done by performing a linear interpolation from `ρaχ / ρa` to `ρχ / ρ`,
using `sgs_weight_function(ρa / ρ, turbconv_model.a_half)` as the weight of
`ρaχ / ρa` in the interpolation. Note that `ρa / ρ` is the "anelastic
approximation" of `a`; we cannot directly use `a` to compute the weight because
this function needs to be called before `a` has been computed. Also, note that
using this function instead of directly computing `ρaχ / ρa` breaks the
assumption of domain decomposition when the approximated `a` is small.
