    boundary_tendency_momentum(ᶜρ, ᶜuₕ, ρ_flux_uₕ_surface)

Calculates the tendency contribution for horizontal momentum (`uₕ`) due to a
specified vertical flux of horizontal momentum at the bottom boundary.

This function constructs a divergence term that is non-zero only in the grid cell
adjacent to the bottom boundary. The divergence effectively introduces the
`ρ_flux_uₕ_surface` as a source/sink. The result is divided by density `ᶜρ`
to yield a tendency for specific horizontal momentum `uₕ`.

Arguments:
- `ᶜρ`: Cell-center air density field.
- `ᶜuₕ`: Cell-center horizontal velocity field (used for type/structure, not value in flux calc).
- `ρ_flux_uₕ_surface`: The vertical flux of horizontal momentum through the bottom
  boundary. This is a `ClimaCore.Geometry.AxisTensor` of type
  `C3{FT} ⊗ C12{FT}` (e.g., representing surface stress `τ` as
  `e_3 ⊗ τ` if defined as flux into the domain, or simply
  the stress vector `τ` if the `SetValue` operator handles the normal).
   Conventionally, a positive flux represents momentum transfer from the
  surface to the atmosphere.

Returns:
- A `ClimaCore.Field` representing the tendency `∂uₕ/∂t` due to the surface flux.

"""
    boundary_tendency_scalar(ᶜχ, ρ_flux_χ_surface)

Calculates the tendency contribution for a scalar quantity `χ` (for the prognostic 
variable `ρχ`) due to a specified vertical flux of that scalar at the bottom boundary.

This function constructs a divergence term that is non-zero only in the grid cell
adjacent to the bottom boundary, effectively introducing `ρ_flux_χ_surface` as a
source/sink. When positive, the flux `ρ_flux_χ_surface` is directed from the surface to 
the atmosphere, i.e., represents an atmospheric source.  

Arguments:
- `ᶜχ`: cell-center scalar field (used for eltype and spatial structure,
  not its values in the flux calculation).
- `ρ_flux_χ_surface`: The vertical flux of the scalar quantity `χ` (density-weighted,
  i.e., flux of `ρχ`) through the bottom boundary. This is a
  `ClimaCore.Geometry.C3{FT}` vector representing the scalar value of the flux.

Returns:
- A `ClimaCore.Field` representing the tendency (e.g., `∂(ρχ)/∂t` or `∂χ/∂t`
  depending on how the caller uses it) due to the surface flux.

"""
    surface_flux_tendency!(Yₜ, Y, p, t)

Applies tendencies to prognostic variables due to surface fluxes.

This function computes and adds contributions from surface fluxes of momentum,
total energy, and total specific humidity (`q_tot`) to their respective tendency
terms in `Yₜ`. Other specific tracers currently have zero surface flux applied by
this function.

The actual flux values are obtained from `p.precomputed.sfc_conditions`.
The tendency contributions are localized to the grid cells adjacent to the
surface using the helper functions `boundary_tendency_momentum` and
`boundary_tendency_scalar`.

The application of these tendencies can be globally disabled via
`p.atmos.disable_surface_flux_tendency`, and momentum flux tendency can be
disabled if vertical diffusion for momentum is inactive.

Arguments:
- `Yₜ`: The tendency state vector, modified in place.
- `Y`: The current state vector.
- `p`: Cache containing parameters, precomputed fields (including `sfc_conditions`),
       and atmospheric model configurations.
- `t`: Current simulation time.
