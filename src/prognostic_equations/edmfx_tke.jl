"""
 edmfx_tke_tendency!(Yₜ, Y, p, t, turbconv_model)

 Applies the tendency from the EDMFX subgrid scale turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
 to the prognostic variables.

 This function calculates and applies the changes in the environment TKE
 (`Yₜ.c.ρtke`) due to various processes within the EDMFX framework,
 including shear production, buoyancy production, entrainment, detrainment,
 turbulent entrainment, pressure work, and dissipation.

 Arguments:
 - `Yₜ`: The tendency state vector.
 - `Y`: The current state vector.
 - `p`: The cache, containing precomputed quantities and parameters.
 - `t`: The current simulation time.
 - `turbconv_model`: The turbulence convection model (e.g., `EDOnlyEDMFX`, `PrognosticEDMFX`).

 Returns: `nothing`, modifies `Yₜ` in place.

"""
    edmfx_tke_sources!(Yₜ, Y, p)

Shear and buoyancy sources of the isotropic (intra-subdomain) TKE, evaluated
with the same face diffusivities and face buoyancy gradient as the diffusive
fluxes they parameterize (`set_face_diffusivities!`):

  - Buoyancy production/destruction `−ρ interp((ᶠK_h + ᶠK_entr) ᶠbuoygrad)`
    is stencil-exact: the product is formed at the faces from the same
    factors as the scalar fluxes and only then interpolated, so it is
    exactly the (interpolated) buoyancy content of those fluxes. In
    unstable layers it is the usual convective production; at stable
    unresolved jumps the `ᶠK_entr ᶠbuoygrad` part carries the interfacial-
    entrainment sink `−γ w_e Δb` per face automatically (bounded by
    `A κ^{3/2}/ℓ_e`, a fixed multiple of the dissipation).
  - Shear production `+2 ρ interp(ᶠK_u + ᶠK_entr) ‖S‖²` corresponds to the
    momentum flux `−2 ρ (ᶠK_u + ᶠK_entr) 𝔈` at the adjacent faces, but only
    approximately at the stencil level: the viscosity is interpolated
    separately and multiplied by the *center* strain-rate norm (the face
    norm is not precomputed), rather than interpolating the face-local
    product. The two agree to second order in smooth flow and differ by an
    O(1) factor only where `K` or `‖S‖²` jumps between adjacent faces.

Only the diffusive (intra-subdomain) piece of the Favre-averaged buoyancy
flux enters this budget. The coherent (mass-flux) piece
`Σ_m ρa^m (w^m - w) b^m` powers the inter-subdomain (coherent) kinetic energy
through the buoyancy term of the subdomain momentum equations, which the
prognostic subdomain velocities already carry; adding it here would
double-count buoyancy production and spuriously inflate K near cloud tops
with active drafts.

    tke_dissipation(turbconv_params, ρtke, tke, mixing_length)

Returns a scalar value representing the TKE dissipation rate
per unit volume, ρ * ε_d [kg m^-1 s^-3].

The physical dissipation is calculated as:
ρ * ε_d = c_d * ρtke * sqrt(abs(tke)) / mixing_length
where `c_d` is the TKE dissipation coefficient
([`tke_dissipation_coefficient`](@ref)).

Arguments:

  - `turbconv_params`: Turbulence and convection model parameters.
  - `ρtke`: ρ_area_weighted * tke [kg m^-2 s^-2].
  - `tke`: Turbulent kinetic energy [m^2 s^-2].
  - `mixing_length`: Turbulent mixing length [m].
