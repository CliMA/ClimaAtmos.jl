# ClimaAtmos diagnostics

# - A dictionary `ALL_DIAGNOSTICS` with all the diagnostics we know how to compute, keyed
#   over their short name. If you want to add more diagnostics, look at the included files.
#   You can add your own file if you want to define several new diagnostics that are
#   conceptually related. The dictionary `ALL_DIAGNOSTICS` should be considered an
#   implementation detail.

Add a new variable to the `ALL_DIAGNOSTICS` dictionary (this function mutates the state of
`ClimaAtmos.ALL_DIAGNOSTICS`).

Keyword arguments
=================


- `short_name`: Name used to identify the variable in the output files and in the file
                names. Short but descriptive. `ClimaAtmos` diagnostics are identified by the
                short name. We follow the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project conventions.

- `long_name`: Name used to identify the variable in the output files.

- `standard_name`: Standard name, as in
                   http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/71/build/cf-standard-name-table.html

- `units`: Physical units of the variable.

- `comments`: More verbose explanation of what the variable is, or comments related to how
              it is defined or computed.

- `compute!`: Function that compute the diagnostic variable from the state.
                             It has to take two arguments: the `integrator`, and a
                             pre-allocated area of memory where to write the result of the
                             computation. It the no pre-allocated area is available, a new
                             one will be allocated. To avoid extra allocations, this
                             function should perform the calculation in-place (i.e., using
                             `.=`).
