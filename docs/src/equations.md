# Equations

!!! note

    This follows what is _currently_ implemented in `examples`: it should be kept up-to-date as code is modified. If you think something _should_ be changed (but hasn't been), please add a note.

This describes the ClimaAtmos model equations and its discretizations. Where possible, we use a coordinate invariant form: the ClimaCore operators generally handle the conversions between bases internally.



## Prognostic variables

* ``\rho``: _density_ in kg/m³. This is discretized at cell centers.
* ``\boldsymbol{u}`` _velocity_, a vector in m/s. This is discretized via ``\boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{u}_h + \boldsymbol{u}_v`` where
  - ``\boldsymbol{u}_h = u_1 \boldsymbol{e}^1 + u_2 \boldsymbol{e}^2`` is the projection onto horizontal covariant components (covariance here means with respect to the reference element), stored at cell centers.
  - ``\boldsymbol{u}_v = u_3 \boldsymbol{e}^3`` is the projection onto the vertical covariant components, stored at cell faces.
* _energy_, stored at cell centers; can be either:
  - ``\rho e``: _total energy_ in J/m³
  - ``\rho e_\text{int}``: _internal energy_ in J/m³
* ``\rho \chi``: _other conserved scalars_ (moisture, tracers, etc), again stored at cell centers.

## Operators

We make use of the following operators

### Reconstruction

* ``I^c`` is the [face-to-center reconstruction operator](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.InterpolateF2C) (arithmetic mean)
* ``I^f`` is the [center-to-face reconstruction operator](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.InterpolateC2F) (arithmetic mean)
* ``WI^f`` is the [center-to-face weighted reconstruction operator](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.WeightedInterpolateC2F)
  - ``WI^f(J, x) = I^f(J*x) / I^f(J)``, where ``J`` is the value of the Jacobian for use in the weighted interpolation operator
* ``U^f`` is the [1st or 3rd-order center-to-face upwind product operator](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.Upwind3rdOrderBiasedProductC2F) # fix link

### Differential operators

- ``\hat{\mathcal{D}}_h`` is the [discrete horizontal spectral weak divergence](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.WeakDivergence).
- ``\mathcal{D}^c_v`` is the [face-to-center vertical divergence](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.DivergenceF2C).
!!! todo
    Add vertical diffusive tendencies (including surface fluxes)

- ``\mathcal{G}_h`` is the [discrete horizontal spectral gradient](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.Gradient).
- ``\mathcal{G}^f_v`` is the [center-to-face vertical gradient](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.GradientC2F).
  - the gradient is set to 0 at the top and bottom boundaries.
- ``\mathcal{C}_h`` is the [curl components involving horizontal derivatives](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.Curl)
  - ``\mathcal{C}_h[\boldsymbol{u}_h]`` returns a vector with only vertical _contravariant_ components.
  - ``\mathcal{C}_h[\boldsymbol{u}_v]`` returns a vector with only horizontal _contravariant_ components.
- ``\hat{\mathcal{C}}_h`` is the [weak curl components involving horizontal derivatives](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.WeakCurl)
- ``\mathcal{C}^f_v`` is the [center-to-face curl involving vertical derivatives](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#ClimaCore.Operators.CurlC2F).
  - ``\mathcal{C}^f_v[\boldsymbol{u}_h]`` returns a vector with only a horizontal _contravariant_ component.
  - the curl is set to 0 at the top and bottom boundaries.
    - We need to clarify how best to handle this.

### Projection

- ``\mathcal{P}`` is the [direct stiffness summation (DSS) operation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCore.jl/stable/operators/#DSS), which computes the projection onto the continuous spectral element basis.

## Auxiliary and derived quantities

* ``\boldsymbol{\Omega}`` is the planetary angular velocity. We use either:
  *  a _shallow atmosphere_ approximation, with
     ```math
     \boldsymbol{\Omega} = \Omega \sin(\phi) \boldsymbol{e}^v
     ```
      where ``\phi`` is latitude, and ``\Omega`` is the planetary rotation rate in rads/sec (for Earth, ``7.29212 \times 10^{-5} s^{-1}``) and ``\boldsymbol{e}^v`` is the unit radial basis vector. This implies that the horizontal contravariant component ``\boldsymbol{\Omega}^h`` is zero.

  *  a _deep atmosphere_, with
     ```math
     \boldsymbol{\Omega} = (0, 0, \Omega)
     ```
     i.e. aligned with Earth's rotational axis.
* ``\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}`` is the mass-weighted reconstruction of velocity at the interfaces:
  by interpolation of contravariant components
  ```math

  ```
* ``\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}`` is the reconstruction of velocity at cell-centers, carried out by linear interpolation of the covariant vertical component:
  ```math
  \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \boldsymbol{u}_h + I_{c}(\boldsymbol{u}_v)
  ```

* ``\Phi = g z`` is the geopotential, where ``g`` is the gravitational acceleration rate and ``z`` is altitude above the mean sea level.
* ``K = \tfrac{1}{2} \|\boldsymbol{u}\|^2 `` is the specific kinetic energy (J/kg), reconstructed at cell centers by
  ```math
  K = \tfrac{1}{2} (\boldsymbol{u}_{h} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_{h} + 2 \boldsymbol{u}_{h} \cdot I_{c} (\boldsymbol{u}_{v}) + I_{c}(\boldsymbol{u}_{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_{v})),
  ```
  where ``\boldsymbol{u}_{h}`` is defined on cell-centers, ``\boldsymbol{u}_{v}`` is defined on cell-faces, and ``I_{c} (\boldsymbol{u}_{v})`` is interpolated using covariant components.

* ``p`` is air pressure, derived from the thermodynamic state, reconstructed at cell centers.
* ``\Pi = (\frac{p}{p_0})^{\frac{R_d}{c_{pd}}}`` is the Exner function evaluated with dry-air constants.
* ``\boldsymbol{F}_R`` are the radiative fluxes: these are assumed to align vertically (i.e. the horizontal contravariant components are zero), and are constructed at cell faces from [RRTMGP.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/RRTMGP.jl).

* ``\nu_u``, ``\nu_h``, and ``\nu_\chi`` are hyperdiffusion coefficients, and ``c`` is the divergence damping factor.

* No-flux boundary conditions are enforced by requiring the third contravariant component of the face-valued velocity at the boundary, ``\boldsymbol{\tilde{u}}^{v}``, to be zero. The vertical covariant velocity component is computed as
  ```math
  \tilde{u}_{v} = \tfrac{-(u_{1}g^{31} + u_{2}g^{32})}{g^{33}}.
  ```

## Equations and discretizations

### Mass

Follows the continuity equation
```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho = - \nabla \cdot(\rho \boldsymbol{u}) + \rho \mathcal{S}_{qt}.
```

This is discretized using the following
```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho
= - \hat{\mathcal{D}}_h[ \rho \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}] - \mathcal{D}^c_v \left[WI^f( J, \rho) \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}} \right] + \rho \mathcal{S}_{qt}
```

with the
```math
-\mathcal{D}^c_v[WI^f(J, \rho) \boldsymbol{u}_v]
```
term treated implicitly (check this)


### Momentum

Uses the advective form equation
```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \boldsymbol{u}  = - (2 \boldsymbol{\Omega} + \nabla \times \boldsymbol{u}) \times \boldsymbol{u} - c_{pd} (\theta_v - \theta_{v, r}) \nabla_h \Pi  - \nabla_h [(\Phi - \Phi_r) + K]. 
```
Here, we use the Exner function to compute pressure gradients and are subtracting a hydrostatic reference state
```math
- \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p = - c_{pd} \theta_v \Pi
```
where ``\theta_v`` is the virtual potential temperature. ``\theta_{v,r} = T_r / \Pi`` is a reference virtual potential temperature (with reference temperature ``T_r``), and 
```math
\Phi_r = -c_{pd} \left[ T_\text{min} \log(\Pi) + \frac{(T_\text{sfc} - T_\text{min})}{n_s} (\Pi^{n_s} - 1) \right],
```
is a reference geopotential, which satisfies the hydrostatic balance equation $c_{pd} \theta_{v,r} \nabla \Pi + \nabla \Phi_r = 0$ for any $\Pi$.
We use the reference temperature profile ``T_r = T_\text{min} + (T_\text{sfc} - T_\text{min}) \Pi^{n_s}``, with constants ``T_\text{min} = 215\,K``, ``T_\text{sfc}= 288\,K``, and ``n_s = 7``.

#### Horizontal momentum

By breaking the curl and cross product terms into horizontal and vertical contributions, and removing zero terms (e.g. ``\nabla_v  \times \boldsymbol{u}_v = 0``), we obtain 
```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \boldsymbol{u}_h  =
  - (2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^h + \nabla_v \times \boldsymbol{u}_h +  \nabla_h \times \boldsymbol{u}_v) \times \boldsymbol{u}^v
  - (2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^v + \nabla_h \times \boldsymbol{u}_h) \times \boldsymbol{u}^h
  - c_{pd} (\theta_v - \theta_{v, r}) \nabla_h \Pi  - \nabla_h [(\Phi - \Phi_r) + K],
```
where ``\boldsymbol{u}^h`` and ``\boldsymbol{u}^v`` are the horizontal and vertical _contravariant_ vectors. 

The effect of topography is accounted for through the computation of the contravariant velocity components (projections from the covariant velocity representation) prior to computing the cross-product contributions.

This is stabilized with the addition of 4th-order vector hyperviscosity
```math
-\nu_u \, \nabla_h^2 (\nabla_h^2(\boldsymbol{\overline{u}})),
```
projected onto the first two contravariant directions, where ``\nabla_{h}^2(\boldsymbol{v})`` is the horizontal vector Laplacian. For grid scale hyperdiffusion, ``\boldsymbol{v}`` is identical to ``\boldsymbol{\overline{u}}``, the cell-center valued velocity vector.
```math
\nabla_h^2(\boldsymbol{v}) = \nabla_h(\nabla_{h} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}) - \nabla_{h} \times (\nabla_{h} \times \boldsymbol{v}).
```

The ``(2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^h + \nabla_v \times \boldsymbol{u}_h + \nabla_h \times \boldsymbol{u}_v) \times \boldsymbol{u}^v`` term is discretized as:
```math
\frac{I^c\{(2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^h + \mathcal{C}^f_v[\boldsymbol{u}_h] + \mathcal{C}_h[\boldsymbol{u}_v]) \times (I^f(\rho J)\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}^v)\}}{\rho J}
```
where
```math
\omega^{h} = (\nabla_v \times \boldsymbol{u}_h + \nabla_h \times \boldsymbol{u}_v)
```

The ``(2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^v + \nabla_h \times \boldsymbol{u}_h) \times \boldsymbol{u}^h`` term is discretized as
```math
(2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^v + \mathcal{C}_h[\boldsymbol{u}_h]) \times \boldsymbol{u}^h
```
and the ``c_{pd} (\theta_v - \theta_{v,r}) \nabla_h \Pi + \nabla_h (\Phi - \Phi_r + K)`` term is discretized as
```math
c_{pd} (\theta_v - \theta_{v,r}) \mathcal{G}_h[\Pi] + \mathcal{G}_h[\Phi - \Phi_r + K] ,
```
where all these terms are treated explicitly.

The hyperviscosity term is
```math
- \nu_u \left\{ c \, \hat{\mathcal{G}}_h ( \mathcal{D}(\boldsymbol{\psi}_h) ) - \hat{\mathcal{C}}_h( \mathcal{C}_h( \boldsymbol{\psi}_h )) \right\}
```
where
```math
\boldsymbol{\psi}_h = \mathcal{P} \left[ \hat{\mathcal{G}}_h ( \mathcal{D}(\boldsymbol{u}_h) ) - \hat{\mathcal{C}}_h( \mathcal{C}_h( \boldsymbol{u}_h )) \right]
```

#### Vertical momentum
Similarly for vertical velocity
```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \boldsymbol{u}_v  =
  - (2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^h + \nabla_v \times \boldsymbol{u}_h + \nabla_h \times \boldsymbol{u}_v) \times \boldsymbol{u}^h
  -c_{pd} (\theta_v - \theta_{v, r}) \nabla_v \Pi  - \nabla_v [(\Phi - \Phi_r)].
```

The ``(2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^h + \nabla_v \times \boldsymbol{u}_h + \nabla_h \times \boldsymbol{u}_v) \times \boldsymbol{u}^h`` term is discretized as
```math
(2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}^h + \mathcal{C}^f_v[\boldsymbol{u}_h] + \mathcal{C}_h[\boldsymbol{u}_v]) \times I^f(\boldsymbol{u}^h) ,
```
The ``\nabla_v K`` term is discretized as
```math
\mathcal{G}^f_v[K],
```
The ``c_{pd} (\theta_v - \theta_{v,r}) \nabla_v \Pi + \nabla_v (\Phi - \Phi_r)`` term is discretized as
```math
I^f[c_{pd} (\theta_v - \theta_{v, r} ) ] \mathcal{G}^f_v[\Pi] - \mathcal{G}^f_v[\Phi - \Phi_r],
```
and is treated implicitly.

This is stabilized with the addition of 4th-order vector hyperviscosity
```math
-\nu_u \, \nabla_h^2 (\nabla_h^2(\boldsymbol{\overline{u}})),
```
projected onto the third contravariant direction.

### Total energy

```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho e = - \nabla \cdot((\rho e + p) \boldsymbol{u} + \boldsymbol{F}_R) + \rho \mathcal{S}_{e},
```
which is stabilized with the addition of a 4th-order hyperdiffusion term on total enthalpy:
```math
- \nu_h \nabla \cdot \left( \rho \nabla^3 \left(\frac{ρe + p}{ρ} \right)\right)
```

This is discretized using
```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho e \approx
- \hat{\mathcal{D}}_h[ (\rho e + p) \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} ]
- \mathcal{D}^c_v \left[ WI^f(J,\rho) \,  \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}} \, I^f \left(\frac{\rho e + p}{\rho} \right)
  + \boldsymbol{F}_R \right] - \nu_h \hat{\mathcal{D}}_h( \rho \mathcal{G}_h(\psi) ).
```
where
```math
\psi = \mathcal{P} \left[ \hat{\mathcal{D}}_h \left( \mathcal{G}_h \left(\frac{ρe + p}{ρ} \right)\right) \right]
```

Currently the central reconstruction
```math
- \mathcal{D}^c_v \left[ WI^f(J,\rho) \,  \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}} \, I^f \left(\frac{\rho e + p}{\rho} \right) \right]
```
is treated implicitly.

!!! todo
    The Jacobian computation should be updated so that the upwinded term
    ```math
    - \mathcal{D}^c_v\left[WI^f(J, \rho) U^f\left(\boldsymbol{u}_v, \frac{\rho e + p}{\rho} \right)\right]
    ```
    is treated implicitly.

### Scalars

For an arbitrary scalar ``\chi``, the density-weighted scalar ``\rho\chi`` follows the continuity equation

```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho \chi = - \nabla \cdot(\rho \chi \boldsymbol{u}) + \rho \mathcal{S}_{\chi}.
```
This is stabilized with the addition of a 4th-order hyperdiffusion term
```math
- \nu_\chi \nabla \cdot(\rho \nabla^3(\chi))
```

This is discretized using
```math
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho \chi \approx
- \hat{\mathcal{D}}_h[ \rho \chi \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}]
- \mathcal{D}^c_v \left[ WI^f(J,\rho) \, U^f\left( \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}},  \frac{\rho \chi}{\rho} \right) \right]
- \nu_\chi \hat{\mathcal{D}}_h ( \rho \, \mathcal{G}_h (\psi) )
```
where
```math
\psi = \mathcal{P} \left[ \hat{\mathcal{D}}_h \left( \mathcal{G}_h \left( \frac{\rho \chi}{\rho} \right)\right) \right]
```

Currently the central reconstruction
```math
- \mathcal{D}^c_v \left[ WI^f(J,\rho) \, \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}} \, I^f\left( \frac{\rho \chi}{\rho} \right) \right]
```
is treated implicitly.

!!! todo
    The Jacobian computation should be updated so that the upwinded term
    ```math
    - \mathcal{D}^c_v\left[WI^f(J, \rho) U^f\left(I^f(\boldsymbol{u}_h) + \boldsymbol{u}_v, \frac{\rho \chi}{\rho} \right) \right]
    ```
    is treated implicitly.

## Microphysics source terms

Sources from cloud microphysics ``\mathcal{S}`` represent the transfer of mass
  between the working fluid (dry air, water vapor cloud liquid and cloud ice)
  and precipitation (rain and snow),
  as well as the latent heat release due to phase changes.

The scalars ``\rho q_{rai}`` and ``\rho q_{sno}`` are part of the state vector
  when running simulations with 1-moment microphysics scheme,
  and represent the specific humidity of liquid and solid precipitation
  (i.e. rain and snow).

```math
q_{rai} := \frac{m_{rai}}{m_{dry} + m_{vap} + m_{liq} + m_{ice}}\; ,
\;\;\;\;
q_{sno} := \frac{m_{sno}}{m_{dry} + m_{vap} + m_{liq} + m_{ice}}
```

The different source terms are provided by
  [CloudMicrophysics.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/CloudMicrophysics.jl) library
  and are defined as the change of mass of one of the cloud condensate or
  precipitation species normalised by the mass of the working fluid.
See the [CloudMicrophysics.jl docs](https://clima.github.io/CloudMicrophysics.jl/dev/)
  for more details.

!!! todo
    Throughout the rest of the derivations we are assuming that the volume
    of the working fluid is constant (not the pressure).
    This is strange for phase changes and needs more thinking.

### Case 1: Mass of the working fluid is changed

When the phase change is happening within the working fluid
  (for example condensation from water vapor to liquid water),
  there is no change to any of the state variables.
Considering the transition from
  ``x \rightarrow y`` where ``x`` is either
   water vapor, cloud liquid water or cloud ice and
  ``y`` is either rain or snow
```math
\mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y} := \frac{\frac{dm_x}{dt}}{m_{dry} + m_{vap} + m_{liq} + m_{ice}}
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho =
\frac{d}{dt} \rho q_{tot} =
\rho \mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y} =
- \frac{d}{dt} \rho q_y
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho e = \rho \mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y} (I_{y} + \Phi)
```
where ``I_{y}`` is the internal energy of the ``y`` phase.
This formula applies to the majority of microphysics processes.
Namely, it is valid for processes where ``T=const`` such as
  autoconversion and accretion between species of the same phase.
It is also valid for rain evaporation, deposition/sublimation, and
  accretion of cloud water and snow in temperatures below freezing
  (which result in snow).

### Case 2: Phase change outside of the working fluid

For cases where both ``x`` and ``y`` are not part of the working fluid
  (melting of snow, freezing of rain)
```math
\mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y} := \frac{\frac{dm_{x}}{dt}}{m_{dry} + m_{vap} + m_{liq} + m_{ice}}
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho q_{x} =
- \frac{d}{dt} \rho q_{y} =
\rho \mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y}
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho = \frac{d}{dt} \rho q_{tot} = 0
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho e = - \rho \mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y} L_{f}
```
where ``L_f`` is the latent heat of fusion.
The sign in the last equation assumes ``x`` stands for rain and ``y`` for snow.

### Additional cases

Accretion of cloud ice by rain results in snow.
This process combines the effects from the loss of working fluid ``q_{ice}``
   (described by case 1)
   and the phase change from rain to snow
   (described by case 2).

Accretion of cloud liquid by snow in temperatures above freezing results in rain.
It is assummed that some fraction ``\alpha`` of snow is melted during the process
  and both cloud liquid and melted snow are turned into rain.

```math
\mathcal{S}_{acc} := \frac{\frac{dm_{liq}}{dt}}{m_{dry} + m_{vap} + m_{liq} + m_{ice}}
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho = \frac{d}{dt} \rho q_{tot} = \rho S_{acc}
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho q_{sno} = \rho \alpha S_{acc}
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho q_{rai} = - \rho (1 + \alpha) S_{acc}
```
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho e = \rho \mathcal{S}_{acc} ((1+\alpha) I_{liq} - \alpha I_{ice} + \Phi)
```

### Precipitation temperature

Precipitation is assumed to have the same temperature as the surrounding air ``T_a``.
The corresponding energy sink associated with heat transfer
  between air and precipitating species can be written as

```math
\frac{d}{dt} \rho e = - \rho q_p (\boldsymbol{u} - v_p) c_p \nabla T_a
```
where ``q_p``, ``\boldsymbol{u}``, ``v_p``, ``c_p `` are the precipitation specific humidity,
air velocity, precipitation terminal velocity assumed to be along the gravity axis,
specific heat of precipitating species.

!!! todo
    We should consider replacing ``T_a`` with
    some approximation of wet bulb temperature.

### Stability and positivity

All source terms are individually limited such that they don't exceed the
  available tracer specific humidity divided by a coefficient ``a``.
```math
\mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y} = min(\mathcal{S}_{x \rightarrow y}, \frac{q_{x}}{a \; dt})
```
This will not ensure positivity because the sum of all source terms,
  combined with the advection tendency,
  could still drive the solution to negative numbers.
It should however help mitigate some of the problems.
The source terms functions treat negative specific humidities as zeros,
  so the simulations should be stable even with small negative numbers.

We do not apply hyperdiffusion for precipitation tracers.

### Aerosol Activation for 2-Moment Microphysics

Aerosol activation uses functions from the [CloudMicrophysics.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/CloudMicrophysics.jl) library, based on the Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (ARG) parameterization. ARG predicts the number of activated cloud droplets assuming a parcel of clear air rising adiabatically. This formulation is traditionally applied only at cloud base, where the maximum supersaturation typically occurs.

To enable ARG to be used locally (i.e., without explicitly identifying cloud base), CloudMicrophysics.jl implements a modified equation for the maximum supersaturation that accounts for the presence of pre-existing liquid and ice particles. This allows activation to be applied inside clouds. To ensure that activation occurs only where physically appropriate, we apply additional clipping logic:

- If the predicted maximum supersaturation is less than the local supersaturation (i.e., supersaturation is decreasing), aerosol activation is not applied.
- If the predicted number of activated droplets is less than the existing local cloud droplet number concentration, activation is also suppressed.

This ensures that droplet activation occurs only in physically meaningful regions—typically near cloud base—even though the activation routine can be applied throughout the domain.
