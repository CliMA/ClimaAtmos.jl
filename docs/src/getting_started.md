## Installing Julia

ClimaAtmos is provided as a Julia package, so it requires having Julia installed. Information about Julia packages is available on the [Julia website](https://julialang.org).

First, download and install Julia by following the instructions at [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Then, you can launch a Julia REPL by running `$ julia --project`

## Installing ClimaAtmos.jl

ClimaAtmos.jl is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). To install

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("ClimaAtmos")
```

Alternatively, you can clone the `ClimaAtmos`
[repository](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl) with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl.git
```
This is useful if you want to keep up with bleeding-edge changes between major releases.

Now change into the `ClimaAtmos.jl` directory with 

```
$ cd ClimaAtmos.jl
```

To use ClimaAtmos, you need to instantiate all dependencies with:

```
$ julia --project
julia> ]
(ClimaAtmos) pkg> instantiate
```

## Some common terminology in ClimaAtmos
The following terms are frequently used within the source code and between collaborators. Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you come across any other key terms that we've missed here.
- `Yₜ`: The tendency state vector, where `Yₜ.sfc` components are modified.
- `Y`: The current state vector.
- `p`: Cache containing parameters, precomputed fields (radiation fluxes, surface
       conditions, precipitation fluxes), atmospheric model configurations, and
       slab model properties.
- `t`: Current simulation time.

The state `Y` is not assigned by default. If you want to explore the state variable, you can follow the steps below. Note that all but the last step below are executed by the [driver](.buildkite/ci_driver.jl).

```Julia
import ClimaAtmos as CA
config = CA.AtmosConfig([your_path_to_config_file])
simulation = CA.get_simulation(config)
Y = simulation.integrator.u
```
