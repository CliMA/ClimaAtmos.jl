# Code Style Guide

This guide covers formatting, variable conventions, and Git workflow for CliMA repositories.

## 1. JuliaFormatter

The root `.JuliaFormatter.toml` is the authoritative source of truth for code formatting. Run the formatter locally before committing:

```bash
julia -e 'using JuliaFormatter; format(".")'
```

or install JuliaFormatter as an app and use directly from the command-line:
```julia-repl
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.Apps.add("JuliaFormatter")
```
and add `~/.julia/bin/` to your PATH.

Then you can run the formatter directly:
```bash
jlfmt -i .
```

### Version consistency

Match the JuliaFormatter version used in CI to prevent unnecessary diff churn. Repos use the `julia-actions/julia-format` GitHub Action and pin a JuliaFormatter major version via the `version:` input:

```yaml
- uses: julia-actions/julia-format@v4
  with:
    version: '1'   # JuliaFormatter major version; check the repo's workflow file
```

Note: the JuliaFormatter major version is not uniform across CliMA repos — some pin `'1'`, others `'2'`, and some leave the default. Always cross-check `.github/workflows/JuliaFormatter.yml` (or `julia_formatter.yml`) in the repo you're working in before formatting. Run the formatter with `julia -e 'using JuliaFormatter; format(".")'` from the repo root.

### Avoiding formatting noise

Do not manually format code inconsistently with the formatter. If the formatter produces unwanted results, adjust `.JuliaFormatter.toml` rather than overriding manually.

Be cautious with `git checkout -- .` to undo formatting changes — this also undoes any uncommitted functional changes. Prefer `git checkout -p` or `git add -i` for selective staging.

## 2. Variable locality

Constants specific to a physical algorithm should be defined as local variables inside the function, not as global module constants:

```julia
function compute_gradient(x, y)
    # Algorithmic constant local to this function
    ε = 1e-8
    # ... logic ...
end
```

This minimizes global namespace pollution and improves code clarity.

## 3. File organization

For large source files, use visual section headers to group related functionality:

```julia
# ============================================================================
# Quadrature Evaluators
# ============================================================================
```

The `test/` directory structure should mirror `src/`:

- **Source**: `src/parameterized_tendencies/microphysics/tendency.jl`
- **Test**: `test/parameterized_tendencies/microphysics/tendency.jl`

## 4. Git workflow

### Rebasing over merging

Prefer **rebasing** over merging to maintain a linear commit history:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

### Starting a new task

Ensure your branch is based on the latest remote `main`:

```bash
git stash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b your/branch-name
git stash pop
```

### Functional commits

Each commit should represent a logical unit of work and maintain model compilability.

## 5. Feature removal

When a feature is deprecated or removed, follow the full cleanup protocol:

1. **Source removal**: delete implementation code, structs, and methods.
2. **Configuration purge**: remove options from config files and parsers. Ensure that choosing a removed option triggers a clear `error` listing valid alternatives.
3. **Test suite cleanup**: delete targeted tests; update integration tests to use supported alternatives. Mirror changes between `src/` and `test/`.
4. **Dependency slimming**: remove packages that were exclusively used by the removed feature from `Project.toml`. See [Dependency Management Guide](../architecture/dependency_management.md).
5. **Documentation update**: update docstrings and docs to reflect the removal.

## 6. Naming and Syntax conventions

### Capitalization

- Modules, structs, and types use `TitleCase`.
- Functions and variables use `snake_case` (lowercase, words separated by underscores).
- Constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Functions that mutate one of their arguments (conventionally the first) end in `!` — e.g. `update!`, `compute_tendency!`.

### Function names

- **Prefer full words over abbreviations.** `compute_strain_rate_full!` is better than `csrf!`. A few extra characters at the definition site are a vanishingly small cost compared to the cost of decoding an unfamiliar abbreviation every time a reader encounters it.
- **Acceptable abbreviations** are universally-understood physics/math symbols (`Φ`, `ρ`, `χ`, `θ`) and well-established acronyms used widely in the relevant subfield (`EDMF`, `RRTMGP`, `SGS`, `PDF`, `LES`). When in doubt, spell it out.
- **Lazy field prefixes (ClimaCore-based repos):** functions that return a lazy cell-center–valued field are prefixed with `ᶜ`; those that return a lazy cell-face–valued field are prefixed with `ᶠ`. Unprefixed functions are understood to be pointwise. For example, `ᶜρ` is a lazy field at cell centers; `ρ` (no prefix) is a pointwise scalar.

### Type names

- **Abstract types: use the bare concept name, not an `Abstract`-prefixed form.** Prefer `CloudModel`, `SpongeModel`, `JacobianAlgorithm` over `AbstractCloudModel`, `AbstractSpongeModel`, `AbstractJacobianAlgorithm`. The concept name reads more naturally in dispatch signatures (`f(x::CloudModel)`) and in documentation. Some legacy code uses `AbstractFoo`; keep it consistent within an existing module, but new hierarchies should drop the prefix.
- **Common suffixes** signal what kind of type a struct is. Use them to make intent obvious at the call site:
  - `…Model`: dispatch tag for a parameterization choice (e.g. `SmagorinskyLilly`, `EDMFModel`).
  - `…Method` / `…Algorithm`: algorithmic choice (e.g. `JacobianAlgorithm`, `TracerNonnegativityMethod`).
  - `…Parameters` or `…Params`: immutable bag of numerical parameters (e.g. `ThermodynamicsParameters`).
  - `…Cache`: mutable workspace or precomputed state (e.g. `AtmosCache`).
- **Avoid generic `…Type` or `…Helper` suffixes** — they don't tell the reader what kind of thing they are looking at.

### Variables

- Follow the conventions in the [Variable List](variable_list.md).
- Avoid one-character names like `l` (lowercase el), `O` (uppercase oh), or `I` (uppercase eye) — they are visually ambiguous.
- One-letter names from physics/math (`T`, `ρ`, `χ`, `Φ`) are fine when they match standard notation in the surrounding code.

### Unicode

- Limit use of Unicode. Avoid combining accents (dot, hat, vec) that create visually ambiguous characters.
- Use only standard Greek letters (`α`, `β`, `Δ`, `χ`, `ρ`, …) and common math symbols (`∇`, `∂`, `∫`, `≤`).
- Exception: the modifier-letter prefixes `ᶜ` and `ᶠ` are idiomatic in ClimaCore-based repos for lazy center/face field functions (see "Function names" above). They are visually distinct and unambiguous.

### Line length

The JuliaFormatter margin is the authoritative line-length limit. Most repos use `margin = 92`; check the repo's `.JuliaFormatter.toml`.

### Imports

Group `using`/`import` statements in the following order, separated by blank lines:

1. Standard library imports.
2. Related third-party imports.
3. Local/application-specific imports.

## Self-correction

If this guide is discovered to be stale or missing a pattern, update it.
