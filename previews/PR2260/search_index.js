[enthalpy_flag], [transform])\n\nA wrapper for the matrix EY, where E(Y) is the \"error\" of the implicit step with the state Y (see below for more details on this). The enthalpy_flag, which can be set to either UseEnthalpyDerivative() or IgnoreEnthalpyDerivative(), specifies whether the derivative of total enthalpy with respect to vertical velocity should be computed or approximated as 0. The transform flag, which can be set to true or false, specifies whether or not the error should be transformed from E(Y) to E(Y)Δt, which is required for non-Rosenbrock timestepping schemes from OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. The default values for these flags are IgnoreEnthalpyDerivative() and false, respectively.\n\nWhen we use an implicit or split implicit-explicit (IMEX) timestepping scheme, we end up with a nonlinear equation of the form E(Y) = 0, where\n\n    E(Y) = Y_imp(Y) - Y = hatY + Δt * T_imp(Y) - Y\n\nIn this expression, Y_imp(Y) denotes the state at some time t + Δt. This can be expressed as the sum of hatY, the contribution from the state at time t (and possibly also at earlier times, depending on the order of the timestepping scheme), and Δt * T_imp(Y), the contribution from the implicit tendency T_imp between times t and t + Δt. The new state at the end of each implicit step in the timestepping scheme is the value of Y that solves this equation, i.e., the value of Y that is consistent with the state Y_imp(Y) predicted by the implicit step.\n\nNote: When we use a higher-order timestepping scheme, the full step Δt is divided into several sub-steps or \"stages\", where the duration of stage i is Δt * γ_i for some constant γ_i between 0 and 1.\n\nIn order to solve this equation using Newton's method, we must specify the derivative EY. Since hatY does not depend on Y (it is only a function of the state at or before time t), this derivative is\n\n    E(Y) = Δt * T_imp(Y) - I\n\nIn addition, we must specify how to divide E(Y) by this derivative, i.e., how to solve the linear equation\n\n    E(Y) * ΔY = E(Y)\n\nNote: This equation comes from assuming that there is some ΔY such that E(Y - ΔY) = 0 and making the first-order approximation\n\n    E(Y - ΔY) approx E(Y) - E(Y) * ΔY\n\nAfter initializing Y to Y0 = hatY, Newton's method executes the following steps:\n\nCompute the derivative E(Y0).\nCompute the implicit tendency T_imp(Y0) and use it to get E(Y0).\nSolve the linear equation E(Y0) * ΔY0 = E(Y0) for ΔY0.\nUpdate Y to Y1 = Y0 - ΔY0.\n\nIf the number of Newton iterations is limited to 1, this new value of Y is taken to be the solution of the implicit equation. Otherwise, this sequence of steps is repeated, i.e., ΔY1 is computed and used to update Y to Y2 = Y1 - ΔY1, then ΔY2 is computed and used to update Y to Y3 = Y2 - ΔY2, and so on. The iterative process is terminated either when the error E(Y) is sufficiently close to 0 (according to the convergence condition passed to Newton's method), or when the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"equations/#Equations","page":"Equations","title":"Equations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"equations/","page":"Equations","title":"Equations","text":"note: Note\nThis follows what is currently implemented in examples: it should be kept up-to-date as code is modified.

Otherwise, ClimaAtmos.jl collaborators will execute the merge with permission from the pull request author.\nNote: for small or minor changes (such as fixing a typo in documentation), the GitHub editor is super useful for forking and opening a pull request with a single click.\nWrite your code with love and care. In particular, conform to existing ClimaAtmos style and formatting conventions. For example, we love verbose and explicit variable names, use TitleCase for types, snake_case for objects, and always.put.spaces.after.commas. For formatting decisions we loosely follow the YASGuide.

Nobody can remember all the defaults, so it is better to introduce them at the high-level API only.\nMake sure that module imports are specific so that it is easy to trace back where functions that are used inside a module are coming from.\nConsider naming abstract Julia types \"AbstractMyType\" in order to avoid confusion for the reader of your code.\nComments in your code should explain why the code exists and clarify if necessary, not just restate the line of code in words.\nBe mindful of namespace issues when writing functional code, especially when writing function code that represents mathematical or physical concepts.\nConsider using keywords in your structs to allow readers to more effectively reason about your code.","category":"page"},{"location":"contributor_guide/#What-is-a-\"collaborator\"-and-how-can-I-become-one?","page":"Contributor Guide","title":"What is a \"collaborator\" and how can I become one?","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"contributor_guide/","page":"Contributor Guide","title":"Contributor Guide","text":"Collaborators have permissions to review pull requests and status allows a contributor to review pull requests in addition to opening them.
