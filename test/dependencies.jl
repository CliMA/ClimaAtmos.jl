# Adding new dependencies to a Julia project has downsides. First, every
# dependency increases the precompilation and import time of a package. For
# complex packages, such as CUDA, this translates in several minutes of
# precompilation time that every single user of ClimaAtmos (including our CI
# runners) always pays. Second, dependencies can increase the cost of
# maintaining ClimaAtmos and the surface area of things that can go wrong (a
# buggy update in a dependency can break ClimaAtmos). Third, dependencies
# increase the complexity of the project's environment, potentially causing
# compatibility issues and restricting the versions we can use.

# This test follows the spirit of the reproducibility tests and tries to capture the
# cost of adding a new dependency by having developers explicitly come here and
# declare their intents.
#
# DO NOT ADD new dependencies if:

# - the feature you need can be easily implemented (e.g., do you need the might
#   of Distributions.jl to compute a guassian function?)
# - your dependency is heavy/has lots of dependencies (e.g., DataFrames, CUDA).
#   Instead, ask around, someone will help you accomplish what you need
# - your dependency implements code that logically should be implemented elsewhere
#   (e.g., if your importing CUDA, maybe we should extend ClimaComms instead).
#   Instead, ask around, someone will help you accomplish what you need
