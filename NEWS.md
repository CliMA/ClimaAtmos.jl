ClimaAtmos.jl Release Notes
============================

Main
-------
### Features

### Allow different sizes of dust and sea salt for radiation

Added functionality to allow five different size bins of dust and sea salt aerosols
for radiation calculation. This feature requires RRTMGP version v0.20.0 or later.
PR [3555](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3555)

### Maintenance

### Rmove FriersonDiffusion option

The option `FriersonDiffusion` is removed from `vert_diff` config. Use `DecayWithHeightDiffusion` instead.
PR [3592](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3592)

v0.28.4
-------
### Development

The `.dev` was deprecated. The two utilities in this folder can be replaced with
more established and better developed tools:
- instead of `clima_format`, use `JuliaFormatter`,
- instead of `up_deps`, use `PkgDevTools`.
See the [documentation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaAtmos.jl/dev/contributor_guide/#Formatting) for more information.

`ClimaAtmos` now only support equilibrium moisture + 0-moment microphysics and 
nonequilibrium + 1-moment microphysics (No precipitation is still supported too).
PR [3557](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3557)

v0.28.3
-------
### Read CO2 from file

`ClimaAtmos` now support using data from the Mauna Loa CO2 measurements to set
CO2 concentration. This is currently only relevant for radiation transfer with
RRTGMP.

### Maintenance

### Remove override_precip_timescale config

![][badge-üî•behavioralŒî] The override_precip_timescale config has been removed.
To recover the previous behavior, set `precipitation_timescale` to `dt` in the
toml. PR [3534](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3534)

v0.28.2
-------
### Features

### Add van Leer class operator

Added a new vertical transport option `vanleer_limiter` (for tracer and energy
variables) which uses methods described in Lin et al. (1994) to apply
slope-limited upwinding. Adds operator

### Read initial conditions from NetCDF files

Added functionality to allow initial conditions to be overwritten by
interpolated NetCDF datasets.

To use this feature from the YAML interface, just pass the path of the file.
We expect the file to contain the following variables:
- `p`, for pressure,
- `t`, for temperature,
- `q`, for humidity,
- `u, v, w`, for velocity,
- `cswc, crwc` for snow and rain water content (for 1 moment microphysics).

For example, to use the DYAMONDSummer initial condition, set
```
initial_condition: "artifact\"DYAMONDSummer\"/DYAMOND_SUMMER_ICS_p98deg.nc"
```
in your configuration file.

### Write diagnostics to text files

Added functionality to write diagnostics in DictWriter to text files.
This is useful for outputting scalar diagnostics, such as total mass of
the atmosphere. PR [3476](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3476)

v0.28.0
-------

v0.27.9
-------

### Features

### New option for vertical diffusion

When `vert_diff` is set to `DecayWithHeightDiffusion`, diffusion decays
exponentially with height.
PR [3475](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3475)

v0.27.8
-------

### Features

### New option for prescribing clouds in radiation

When `prescribe_clouds_in_radiation` is set to true, clouds in radiation
is prescribed from a file (monthly cloud properties in 2010 from ERA5).
PR [3405](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3405)

### ETOPO2022 60arc-second topography dataset.

- Update artifacts to use 60arc-second ETOPO2022 ice-surface topography
  dataset. Update surface smoothing functions to rely only on spectral
  Laplacian operations. Update raw-topo gravity wave parameterization
  dataset. Update interfaces in `make_hybrid_spaces` to support new
  inputs using `SpaceVaryingInput` utility. Include a simple example
  to generate spectra from scalar variables.
  PR [3378](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3378)

v0.27.7
-------

### Features

### Reproducible restarts for simulations with clouds with RRTMGP

- Reset the RNG seed before calling RRTGMP to a known value (the iteration number).
  When modeling cloud optics, RRTGMP uses a random number generator. Resetting
  the seed every time RRTGMP is called to a deterministic value ensures that the
  simulation is fully reproducible and can be restarted in a reproducible way.
  Disable this option when running production runs.

  Note: Setting this option to `true` is behavior-changing.
  PR [3382](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3382)

### ![][badge-üêõbugfix] Bug fixes

- Update RRTMGP to v0.19.1, which fixes the sea salt aerosol lookup table.
  Sea salt aerosol is added to the target amip config.
  PR [3374](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3374)

- Fixed radiation diagnostics conflicting with each other. Prior to this change,
  adding multiple diagnostics associated to the same variable would lead to
  incorrect results when the more diagnostics were output at the same time. PR
  [3365](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3365)

- ClimaAtmos no longer fails when reading restart files generated with versions
  of ClimaAtmos prior to `0.27.6`. PR
  [3388](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3388)

v0.27.6
-------

### Features

### Ozone model is now a dispatchable type

The `prescribe_ozone` flag was turned into a type, allowing for prescribing
arbitrary ozone concentrations. The two types that are currently implemented are
`IdealizedOzone` (implementing a static profile from Wing 2018), and
`PrescribedOzone` (reading from CMIP6 forcing files).

### Aerosol and ozone data can now be automatically downloaded

Prescribed aerosol and ozone concentrations require external files. Now, a
low-resolution version of such files is automatically downloaded when a
higher-resolution version is not available. Please, refer to ClimaArtifacts for
more information.

### ![][badge-üêõbugfix] Bug fixes

  simulation. PR [3287](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3287)

  which only requires z_elem and dz_bottom.

  (https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/3064).

v0.24.1
-------

v0.24.0
-------
- ![][badge-üí•breaking]. CPU/GPU runs can now share the same yaml files. The driver now calls `AtmosConfig` via `(; config_file, job_id) = ClimaAtmos.commandline_kwargs(); config = ClimaAtmos.AtmosConfig(config_file; job_id)`, which recovers the original behavior. PR [#2994](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/2994), issue [#2651](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/issues/2651).
- Move config files for gpu jobs on ci to config/model_configs/.
  PR [#2948](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/2948).

v0.23.0
-------
- ![][badge-‚ú®feature/enhancement]![][badge-üí•breaking]. Use
  [ClimaUtilities](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaUtilities.jl) for
  `TimeVaryingInputs` to read in prescribed aerosol mass concentrations. This PR
  is considered breaking because it changes `AtmosCache` adding a new field,
  `tracers`. PR [#2815](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/2815).

- ![][badge-‚ú®feature/enhancement]![][badge-üí•breaking]. Use
    [ClimaUtilities](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaUtilities.jl) for
    `OutputPathGenerator` to handle where the output of a simulation should be
    saved. Previously, the output was saved to a folder named `$job_id`. Now, it
    is saved to `$job_id/output-active`, where `output-active` is a link that
    points to `$job_id/output-XXXX`, with `XXXX` a counter that increases ever
    time a simulation is run with this output directory. PR
    [#2606](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/2606).

v0.22.1
-------
- ![][badge-üöÄperformance] Reduced the number of allocations in the NetCDF
  writer. PRs [#2772](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/2772),
  [#2773](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/2773).
- Added a new script, `perf/benchmark_netcdf_io.jl` to test IO performance for
  the NetCDF writer. PR [#2773](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl/pull/2773).
